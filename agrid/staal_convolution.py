    Keyword arguments:
    file_name  --  Name of shapefile containing lines
    kernel_size --  Size of Gaussian kernel. Larger is slower, but generate a broader 
                        gradient. 
    sigma --  Standard deviation for layer
    norm  --  Normalise distribution to [0,1]
    p_att --  Attribute for vertices P (rating)
    w_att  --  Attribute for vertices W (rating)
