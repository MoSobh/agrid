# agrid
A grid for modelling, analyse, map and visualise multidimensional and multivariate data. The module contains a class for generating grid objects with variables and functions that defines a multidimensional space with spatial extent. 

Main features:
  - Named coordinates using xarray
  - Fast process of high resolution and low resolution data
  - Using dask arrays
  - 2D map plots and cross-sections
  - 3D visualisation
  - Features for modelling, analysis and visualisation
 
The repo contains: 
 - Module with class for functions and variables. 
 - Jupyter notebook tutorials:
  - 1. The grid object
  - 2. Import data
  - 3. Visualize data
  - 4. Introduction to processing and modelling using grid. 
 - TikZ code for generating illustrations.
 
To come soon: 
 - Software Meta-paper
 - Updates

This shared code can be used as a package or just copy and paste snippets into your project. I've tried to keep the dependencies to a minimum and let the functions be rather independent. 
Future development: 

 - Non regular grids
 - Hexagonal grids
 - More visualisation option
 - More robust import functions
